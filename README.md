ReRAW is an open-source project that aims to recreate the original WWF RAW (2002), the game developed by Jakks Pacific. This repository currently contains only XPK Explorer.

<h3>XPK Explorer</h3>
<p>
XPK Explorer is a tool designed to replace the original XPKGui. This initial version may be quite buggy, but it is capable of reading the contents of .XPK game archives and exporting the files.
